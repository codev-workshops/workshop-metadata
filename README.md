# Devin Training & Hands-On Labs

The one-stop content hub for Devin enablement: reading courses, hands-on lab modules, workshop sequences, and facilitator-led demos — plus the prompts and repository references that make them runnable.

Content is split by **how you consume it**: **`courses/`** is reading-first enablement you work through in sequence for your role; **`workshops/`** and **`labs/`** are hands-on, choose-your-own-adventure material you pick from.

## Quick Start

1. **Building intuition first?** Start with [`courses/foundations/`](courses/foundations/) — reading-first, no coding
2. **Ready for hands-on?** Check `workshops/` for your session's lab guide, or ask your facilitator for the direct link
3. **Pick a lab** — each lab has a prompt you copy-paste into a new Devin session
4. **Kick off and move on** — Devin works autonomously. Start the next lab while it runs
5. **Review the PR** — when Devin finishes, review its pull request and leave comments to iterate

> **Devin works autonomously on its own machine.** Once you paste a prompt and kick off a session, Devin runs independently — you don't need to watch it. Move on to the next lab, explore Ask Devin, or grab coffee while it works. You'll get notified when it opens a PR.

## Tips for Getting the Most from Your Workshop

- **Start sessions early, review later.** Each lab has a "Paste into Devin" step and a separate "Review & Give Feedback" step. Kick off the session first, then use the wait time for Ask Devin research — Devin keeps working in the background.
- **Run parallel sessions.** Kick off the next lab while reviewing the previous one. This mirrors real enterprise usage where Devin handles work across many services simultaneously.
- **Use Ask Devin to refine requirements.** The better-defined a task is, the better Devin's output. Ask Devin helps you think through the problem before creating a session.
- **Build up Devin's knowledge as you go.** When Devin suggests a Knowledge item during a session, accept it — this builds a shared context layer that makes Devin more effective over time.
- **Leave PR comments to steer Devin.** After Devin opens a PR, leave comments directly on the diff and Devin will wake up and address them — this is the core workflow for iterating with Devin.

## Running Apps Locally

Some labs require a running application. See [reference/runtime-resources.md](reference/runtime-resources.md) for local run instructions. Your facilitator will let you know if hosted instances are available.

## Repository Catalog

Looking for a specific repo? The [catalog](catalog/repos.md) lists all repositories in the workshop org with descriptions, tech stacks, and links to the labs that use them.

## Devin Features Checklist

Track your progress on the [Devin Features Appendix](labs/devin-features/README.md) — try to discover as many Devin capabilities as you can during the session.
