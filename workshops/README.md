# Workshops

Reusable workshop definitions that can be instantiated as events. Each workshop is a self-contained reference describing the labs, modules, repos, and structure needed to run a specific type of hands-on session.

## Workshop vs. Event

| | Workshop | Event |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Reusable reference template | Specific instance with date, location, audience |
| **Location** | `workshops/` | `events/` |
| **Contains** | Labs, modules, repos, structure, timing | Links to a workshop + facilitator overrides, audience context, event-specific customizations |
| **Example** | `workshops/legacy-modernization/` | `events/2026-04-dc/` |

## How It Works

1. **Workshops define the content.** Each workshop has a set of labs with the 4-step format (Get Started Fast, Level Up with AskDevin, Explore with DeepWiki, Review PR and Give Feedback), required repos, timing guidelines, and target outcomes.

2. **Events instantiate workshops.** An event links to one or more workshops, adds event-specific details (date, location, audience context), and can override any workshop content for that specific instance.

3. **Modules are the atoms.** Both workshops and events reference modules from `modules/` — the individual challenge definitions that contain the detailed instructions.

## Creating a New Workshop

1. Create a new directory under `workshops/` with a descriptive slug (e.g., `workshops/cloud-native-transformation/`)
2. Add a `README.md` following the structure of any existing workshop
3. Define labs using the 4-step format
4. List required modules and repos
5. Add timing guidelines for different duration variants

## Creating an Event from a Workshop

1. Copy `events/_template/` to a new directory named `YYYY-MM-DD-city/`
2. Reference the workshop(s) this event is based on
3. Add event-specific details (date, location, audience context)
4. Override any workshop content as needed for this specific audience
5. List which repos need to be set up on Devin's machine
